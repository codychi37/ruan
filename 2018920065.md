> The legal world lost a great talent when Tenko started working as technical support at SiteGround back in 2004, while in his second year in law school. But one cannot resist true love when he meets it and for Tenko this was definitely the world of technology. Today, Tenko is the main driving force and one of the masterminds behind the success of SiteGround. (from About SiteGround;https://www.siteground.com/people)
